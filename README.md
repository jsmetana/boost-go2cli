# boost-go2cli

This is a basic utility to interface with [Boost](https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost)
using the CLI it provides.

It might not be the prettiest, but it could work, provided the versions match.

This is work in progress. There is no warranty of anything.

This project has no affiliation with Boost, Filecoin, Protocol Labs or any other
organisation, project or any other entity.
